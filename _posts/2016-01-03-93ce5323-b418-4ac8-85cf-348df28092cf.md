Should I wait for real break?

## 

"_A real man makes his own luck"
-- Billy Zane, Titanic_

## 

Every
time I watch Titanic, I make sure I hear this sentence repeatedly. Why? Not
because of its manchastic tone and temperament but because it holds so true for
everyone who chooses to believe.

## 

We
are fortunate enough to be living in a day and time when individualistic valour
is at its best. We are well-connected, well-travelled, well-read and well-aware
of things which affect us and which don't. In fact, it won't be wrong to say we
are controlling our own passion, fuelling our own dreams and are masters of our
own destiny.

## 

I
strongly believe that our world is full of possibilities and opportunities.
Everything is within our reach and all we need to do is just be 'ready', be
'available' for life to happen, at our doorstep. 

## 

To
be successful or simply ahead of your game, i have realized simply this one
thing -- give up day-dreams, work on them! For instance, I wouldn't wait for
that one phone call to offer me my dream job. Instead, I would approach the
employer and if I am lucky enough to be given five minutes of his, I will make
a lasting first impression. Or, I will communicate in the best way possible via
a digital medium, like e-mail or chat to grab the job/role I so want.

## 

Write your own success story

## 

There
are many people we idolize and try and be like them in our daily life. Have you
ever wondered what makes successful people successful? Apart from having some
great skill, interpersonal charm, unmatched charisma and humble attitude it's
their -- Will to succeed. 

## 

At
first your role model may sound just like you. But when you know them better
you realize they have a burning passion towards their craft. They have an
undying spirit to toil when everyone gives up on them. They have a lightning
self-believe in themselves. 

## 

Behind
all the glitter and glamour is a thunderous spirit which pushes them to compete
with themselves. They have not depended on good luck to knock at their doors.
Instead they have earned their own fortune, in order to fulfil their dreams and
be accepted by everyone. 

## 

When
you study the autobiography of your role-model you get to know of a story. A
personal story of their hardships, of their love and of their passion. A story
which captivates and inspires us. 

## 

This
is the story you need to write your own success. Without which you would never
achieve success or even enjoy it, in its true essence. 

This is the only ingredient for a life of creativity,
you get hurt, you fall, you rise and you walk again. Never ever giving up on
the path you laid out for yourself.

## 

The
idea is never to be scared of the unknown. For mystery brings beauty and vitality
in our being. It aspires us to push our ideals even higher and work a little
more everyday to achieve them.

## _

Triumph is a
sum total of a life of hardship you dedicate to reach the top and stick their,
for as long as you wish to._

## 

Real
beauty lies in taking tiny steps each day, keeping just one thing in mind --
your goal is achievable and you are the creator of your own path. Everything
else will sort out from there. When you fuel your passion, no matter how it is
received gives you the confidence and strength to after them. Only this is pure
happiness, blended in true human freedom. 

## 

Waiting
for luck to manifest itself is like waiting for that bonfire on the beach to
light itself up. Which I don't think is what you really think is possible. You
know yourself and you have to create that 'big break' for your abilities to
rise and shine.

## 

Failure
will be present at all times in the process. But real failure is waiting and
not trying at all. When you fail you will learn. With learning will come more
wisdom to go for it again, this time in a different way. So, actually, we have
nothing to lose. Failure is powerless. It can only halt us for a while but not
take the enthusiasm away from us.

## 

Always
remember,

"_Luck is a matter of preparation meeting opportunity" -- Oprah
Winfrey _

So,
chart your own way to meet and greet your luck.
